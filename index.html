    <p>Helping cinematic artists in Southwest Missouri create projects that uplift our spirits and enhance our communities!</p>

    <p><h2>Where it all started…</h2>
      If anyone has ever tried to get a screenplay or a cinematic idea or project into the hands of film production companies, you’ve probably already discovered that the odds of success are near zero. That’s why we decided to create a nonprofit production company! We wanted to give Southwest Missouri creative artists a platform to self produce projects that otherwise would have been impossible. 
      
      So, out of frustration and failure, Great Wonders Productions was birthed. A small group of individuals decided that anything was possible if we only worked together and supported one another’s ideas and dreams. Could we, as a nonprofit entity, raise the needed funding to self produce video projects as monumental as a full length dramatic movie? A sitcom pilot? A documentary or a dramatic series? We decided that, YES, this was possible and the only way to know for sure was to move forward!
      
      On December 8th, 2022, we held a meeting with individuals from existing arts organizations in Joplin, and simply “dreamed out loud” of what our vision entailed. That meeting ended with a comment by one of the leading arts advocates in the State of Missouri. She simply said, “I hope you leave here encouraged.” That one sentence was a key factor in moving forward.
      
      Just 7 weeks later, after many meetings and conversations, we officially incorporated as a nonprofit in the State of Missouri as, “Great Wonders Productions”. And, just 3 weeks later, we received our 501(c)3 nonprofit status approval from the IRS. So, we invite you, now, to follow our journey as we continue to “dream out loud” and venture to create video projects that uplift our spirits and enhance our communities.

      <img class='promoImg' src="https://stackblitz.com/storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBek5pQXc9PSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--37d56d24908a243c1194f89934685704c6c19d82/The-Redemption-of-MLmB-INSERT-1-768x540.jpg" alt="The Redemption of Mary Louisa McBroom">
      <p>Our current project is a screenplay that tells the story of generational abuse and childhood trauma. It deals with issues like alcoholism, mental illness, poverty and broken relationships. Although these are hard topics and can be emotionally uncomfortable, this story offers hope of redemptions and gives the viewers permission to tell their own stories. We are presently working on a dramatic stage reading as well as a movie trailer. Then we will endeavor to start production on stand alone sections of the screenplay.</p>
